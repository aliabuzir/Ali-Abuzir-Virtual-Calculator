# Ali-Abuzir-Virtual-Calculator
Program that creates a virtual calculator to perform simple operations. Program created in programming language Java.
Program has features of recording history as well as allowing the user to choose their favorite equation in history.
Program is ongoing to add even more usability.
I plan on adding features such as a car loan in which I take in more input to get an accurate estimate of how much total money it costs to purchase a car after all fees based on user's current city.
